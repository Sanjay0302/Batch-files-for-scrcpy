*Where true wireless.bat dont need USB cable to start the scrcpy cmd Which works on wireless debugging feature
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*And partially wireless.bat helps to connect both wirelessly and wired connections to start scrcpy cmd but for initial setup u need to have USB cable until cmd promts displays you to remove usb cable
